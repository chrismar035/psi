Presence Solution Innovations, or PSI, is a web design and construction company based on Streetsboro, OH. <BR> We are currently a one man organization.
I, Chris (Hi!), do it all and I promise to <span class='highlight'>take care of you and your needs from start to finish</span> and beyond.
<BR><BR><p>I am dedicated to creating innovative solutions to the web presence needs of today's businesses. I specialize in getting you established on the 
web and <span class='highlight'>creating unique and dynamic ways to deliver your products or services</span> to your customers and clients.
<BR><BR><p>Whether you are established on the web, or are just dipping your toes, <span class='highlight'>I'm here for you.</span> I do two things for my clients. 
First, I take <span class='highlight'>your ideas and goals</span> and convert them into actionable solutions for the internet. From a blog or news system to and 
online store to a web portal to connect employees across the globe, I provide each <span class='highlight'>unique client with a unique solution</span>. Second, 
I will build your site for you. I have some template ideas to get us started, but you don't have to pick from our catalog or hope that you fit into one of 
five designs. <span class='highlight'>Your business is unique and your site should be too.</span>
<BR><BR><p>Another cool thing about Presence is that I am completely transparent with my work. You can be as involved in the project as you want. If you want 
to point me in a direction and I'll come back with something awesome, that is great. If you would like to check-in all along the way and tweak things as we go, 
that is great too. You are free to see the work in progress at any time. It is always available.
<BR><BR>Last thing, then I'll leave you to <a href='clients.html'>check out my work</a>, we always offer a <span class='highlight'>90 day money back guarantee</span>. 
If at any point during the development process or up to 90 days from a project completion date you are unsatisfied, for any reason, just let me know and I will give you
any money you've put into that project. Also, keep anything I've deployed to your site. Don't worry though, that won't happen. ;)
<BR><BR>That was an overview of what I do and my philosophy. For more specifics, check out <a href='pricing.html'>the pricing guide</a>.
